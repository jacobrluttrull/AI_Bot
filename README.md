# AI_Bot (Tool-Using Coding Agent)

AI_Bot is a command-line AI coding assistant built in Python that can interact with a local project through a controlled set of tools. It supports both one-shot prompts and an interactive REPL mode, allowing the assistant to inspect files, write changes, execute Python scripts, and run automated tests.

This project goes beyond a basic chatbot by implementing a functional agent loop that can decide when to call tools, use tool output as context, and continue until a final response is produced.

This project is intended to be run on Linux/WSL (recommended) for the most consistent behavior and best compatibility.

## Key Features (Beyond the Base Boot.dev Project)

### Interactive REPL Mode
AI_Bot includes a REPL chat mode that keeps conversation context across multiple turns.
* Start the bot once and interact continuously
* Exit cleanly when finished

### Tool Calling (Local Function Execution)
The assistant can call local tools to perform real operations inside the project:
* List files and directories
* Read file contents
* Write or overwrite files
* Execute Python files with optional arguments
* Run pytest test suites

### Multi-Step Agent Loop
Instead of responding once and stopping, AI_Bot can:
1. Evaluate the request
2. Call the appropriate tool(s)
3. Interpret the results
4. Continue tool usage until the task is completed (or a safety limit is reached)

### Test Runner Integration (`run_tests`)
AI_Bot includes a `run_tests` tool that executes pytest and returns:
* Exit code
* Command used
* STDOUT / STDERR output

It also supports selecting which tests to run by path (example: `tests` vs `calculator/tests`).

### Working Directory Injection for Safety
Tool calls automatically receive a controlled working directory to reduce risk of unsafe path access. This keeps file operations scoped to expected locations.

## Requirements
* Python 3.12+
* uv
* Linux or WSL (recommended)
* OpenAI API key

## Setup

1) **Create a `.env` file**

In the project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

2) **Install dependencies**

```
uv sync
```

## Usage

### One-Shot Mode
Run a single prompt and exit:

```
uv run main.py "list the files in the root"
```

### REPL Mode
Start an interactive session:

```
uv run main.py
```

Example REPL prompts:
* `list the files in the root`
* `read the contents of main.py`
* `write 'hello' to main.txt`
* `run tests`
* `run tests in calculator/tests`

## Notes
This project demonstrates a practical tool-using agent workflow in a controlled local environment. The main focus is on building a functional coding agent with multi-step execution, test running, and safe project interaction rather than a simple chat-only bot.
